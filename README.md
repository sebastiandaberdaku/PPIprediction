# PPIprediction

software used in the paper "Exploring the potential of 3D Zernike descriptors and SVM for protein–protein interface prediction"

Folders *interface_descriptors_train* and *interface_descriptors_test* contain the C++ sources for, respectively, the **train** and **test** executables. They both require the Boost C++ library (specifically boost_program_options boost_regex boost_system and boost_filesystem).

                                        of each atom. If not specified, the

                                        used for PDB files. It is ignored if

                                        hydrogen atoms are absent. Sometimes 
                                        hydrogens are added by modeling. 
                                        Hydrogens are always present in PDB

The "CHARMM22" file contains the atomic radii information used during the surface computation process. Users can append new entries at the end of this file, modify existing ones, or create their own file with the desired radius assignment for each atom type. It is required by both the "train" and "test" binaries to function correctly. The easiest way to correctly run the binaries would be to place all files in the same directory: train/test binary, CHARMM22 file and the two PDB files. The location of the CHARMM22 file can also be supplied to the binaries with the "--atom_radii" command line option followed with the full path to the file.
