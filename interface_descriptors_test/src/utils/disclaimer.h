/**

#define VWS "Van der Waals surface (or van der Waals envelope) \n\
Named after Johannes Diderik van der Waals, it is the imaginary surface \
of the union of spherical atom surfaces defined by the so-called van der Waals \
radius of each atom in the molecule representation. The van der Waals surface \
enclosed volume reference is \"molecular volume\". \n\n"
/**
 * Definition of SAS
 */
#define SAS "Solvent-accessible surface (or Lee-Richards surface) \n\
Described by the center of the probe as it rolls along the atoms' van der Waals \
spheres. \n\
Corresponds to using an extended sphere around each atom (at a distance from \
the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and probe radii), and eliminating \
those points that lie within neighbour spheres.\
The accessible surface is therefore sort of an expanded van der Waals surface.\
It is larger (more external) than the \"molecular\" surface. \n\n"
/**
 * Definition of MS
 */
#define MS "Molecular surface (or solvent-excluded surface, or Connolly surface) \n\
\
Described by the closest point of the solvent \"probe\" as it rolls along the atoms' \
vdW spheres. In other words: the surface traced by the inward-facing surface of the \
probe. Still in other words: the evolute of the surface of the probe. Composed of \n\
- contact surface: is the part of the vdW surface that can be touched by the probe. \n\
- reentrant surface: formed by the inward-facing part of the probe when it is in \
contact with more than one atom. \n\
(Delimits the solvent-excluded volume in Connolly's terminology, equal to \
van der Waals volume plus interstitial volume). The surface is smaller (more internal) \
than the solvent-accesible surface. \n\n"
